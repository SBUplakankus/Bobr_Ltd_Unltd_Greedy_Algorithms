## 📝 Reflections

### Seán

I learned alot about Greedy Algorithms doing this project in the group. We had not covered it yet in class but I was familiar with the name since I know it is commonly used in game development thanks to it being very efficient. It was fun working with Nikita and Fuhad to learn how it worked and when to use it. I also enjoyed coding out the examples and creating the documentation for them on GitHub. I have recently been rewatching all the Alien, Predator and Alien vs Predator movies, so I really enjoyed turning a famous scene from Aliens into a C++ Example.

I have done a lot of teaching work, voluntary and paid in my free time the last few years, so the idea of coming up with a presentation as part of a college project was really cool and something I enjoyed very much. I would love to do more stuff like this in the future as to teach someone about something, you yourself have to know mostly everything about it.

### Fuhad
This project pushed me to learn about Greedy Algorithms. Developing the Coin Change example taught me to balance simplicity with educational value. I focused on core greedy principles while obeying the algorithm's limitations.

Integrating my code required mastering the project's structure, which I achieved by studying my teammates' work. This experience highlighted that effective teaching relies on clear examples, not just complex code. I appreciate my group mates Seán and Nikita for their collaboration and hardwork as this project would not have been near this quality without them.
